## 1. Project Idea

The main idea behind **Lebroner** is to create a centralized, beautifully designed fan platform for LeBron James.
Basketball fans around the world admire greatness, yet there isn’t one simple platform where people can watch legendary highlights, explore records, and learn more about LeBron's journey on and off the court.
**Lebroner** aims to become the go-to fan hub - celebrating LeBron’s impact on basketball, culture, and history.

**Lebroner** solves this by offering a unified space to relive iconic moments and browse career achievements.
